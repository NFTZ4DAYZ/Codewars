# Codewars

Codewars is where thugs learn to about data structures & algorthms!  

## Overview

My true journey into JavaScript began here.  After countless hours of reading, watching lectures, and actual coding I was ready to step my game up!

Codewars is a phenomenal platform, which allows software engineers like myself to practice solving complex riddles inolving key topics in your
favorite programming language.

The application rewards your peformance with honor points & strongly encourages best practices.  Once a riddle is solved, you can compare your 
answers to those of your clan and the top upvoted ones.

### The hustle

I've managed to solve a handful of katas a day on average of my favorite Javascript riddles and am now working my way into Solidity.  Problems I had to ask for help on
at first are now second nature to me and I'm working to start creating video content that will aim to help other people to effectively learn the material!

As a programmer, I feel 
much more comfortable when coding and my pace has improved dramatically.  I often myself dreaming about these smooth and complicated riddles that sooth my Anxiety.
